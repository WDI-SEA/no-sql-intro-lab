# NoSQL Research Lab

## Explainer
Up until now in the cohort we have stored data only in what are known as relational databases (SQL is the most well known type of relational DB querying language). Relational databases structure our data into tables. Today we will learn about a different type of database: a non-relational one. 

## Lab

In this lab you will be researching, either individually or in groups, answer to the following questions about noSQL databases. The intention is for you to spend some time learning about the fundamental differences between the type of databases we have seen before and the new type we will be learning about today. Even more importantly, you will learn about why two types of databases are used, and what situations fit each type of db. 

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository and answer questions as you research directly in the README. You do not have to submit this lab, but you will want to have it on hand for reference in the future. 

# Questions:
1. What does the term noSQL refer to, and what other term is often used synonymously with noSQL?
- noSQL refers to any non-relational database. Sometimes "non-SQL" or "not only SQL" is used interchangably with noSQL.

2. What are some of the common arguments for using a non-relational versus a relational db?
- built with cloud deployment in mind
- can better handle large data, in terms of scale and speed
- makes it easier to add new data fields to existing database structure

3. In this class we will be using the document style of non-relational databases. What are the charecteristics of a document based db? 
- a document is composed of field and value pairs, and a non-relational database consists of these documents.

4. In this class we will be using Mongo specificially as our no-SQL db. Look into Mongo and answer this question: what is the priamry difference between how Mongo is maintained vrs SQL?
- fundamental difference: SQL itself is a query language, whereas MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. In terms of non-relational vs. relational, noSQL dbs generally have less maintenance and less training requirements.

5. Mongo DBs are organized into documents. Describe an example of a table in SQL that contains users, and then describe the equivalent DB setup in Mongo. 
- SQL user table could have columns consisting of id, username, email, password, birthday, bio. The id is a unique property/identifier.
- MongoDB user collection would have field/value pairs within a document object consisting of _id, username, email, password, birthday, bio. The _id is an autogenerated Object id.

6. What is an example situation where a Mongo database makes sense versus a non-relational db?
- Storing arrays of information: MongoDB collections can include other datatypes like arrays, which SQL can't do
- JSON: MongoDB objects are similar to JSON, therefore translate better into JS applications.
- large scale and always changing: web applications such as social media platforms would be better suited for nonSQL dbs because of the sheer amount of data being stored and changed.
