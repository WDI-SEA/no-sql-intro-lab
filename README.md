# NoSQL Research Lab

## Explainer
Up until now in the cohort we have stored data only in what are known as relational databases (SQL is the most well known type of relational DB querying language). Relational databases structure our data into tables. Today we will learn about a different type of database: a non-relational one. 

## Lab

In this lab you will be researching, either individually or in groups, answer to the following questions about noSQL databases. The intention is for you to spend some time learning about the fundamental differences between the type of databases we have seen before and the new type we will be learning about today. Even more importantly, you will learn about why two types of databases are used, and what situations fit each type of db. 

## Setup

Fork and clone this repository and answer questions as you research directly in the README. You do not have to submit this lab, but you will want to have it on hand for reference in the future. 

# Questions:
1. What does the term noSQL refer to, and what other term is often used synonymously with noSQL?
    - NoSQL refers to a databases that are used in realtime, it is a schemaless doucment-based also known as non-relational databases.
2. What are some of the common arguments for using a non-relational versus a relational db?
    - Some of the arguments that I have found were:
        - the tables in SQL are fixed rows and columns but in noSQL it is JSON documents with key-value pairs and wide-columns with tables and rows
        -   SQL requires Object relational mapping where in noSQL it is not required
3. In this class we will be using the document style of non-relational databases. What are the charecteristics of a document based db? 
    - a document based db is composed of a field and value pairs
    - BSON (binary-JSON)
    - BSON is an addition to JSON that has data types like ObjectID that is specfic to the object that is in the database
4. In this class we will be using Mongo specificially as our no-SQL db. Look into Mongo and answer this question: what is the priamry difference between how Mongo is maintained vrs SQL?
    - the bigget difference between the two are the way they handle data. 
    - In SQL databases, data is stored in form of traditional 2 dimensional row-column structure while in MongoDB rich data document model is followed, which allows storage of any type
5. Mongo DBs are organized into documents. Describe an example of a table in SQL that contains users, and then describe the equivalent DB setup in Mongo.
    - a table that contians users in SQL, would show an Id specifically for the the row and then the character that was put into the mirgations and then createdAt which is automatically generated by SQL
    - in a document in a noSQL, the informaiton would be in a collection as objects 
6. What is an example situation where a Mongo database makes sense versus a non-relational db?
    - an app like a social media app, Instagram
